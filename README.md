# Scheduling-Software
A tool to help uAlberta students build their schedules

In its current iteration, the project simply creates a MongoDB database with metadata about each class, course, and subject offered by the University of Alberta.
In the future, this database will be utilized to generate schedules for students based on which courses they want to take.
